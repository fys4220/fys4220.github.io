# Content & learning objectives

This course gives and introduction to the design of digital and embedded systems using programmable logic (FPGA technology). This includes hardware description language (VHDL), verification and testing of digital designs, implementation of embedded systems in FPGAs, and the basic properties of Real-time operating systems.

The material that will be covered is divided into four main parts:
<!--
* An introduction to programmable logic devices and FPGAs
* VHDL
* Embedded systems
* Real-time operating systems
-->

You will find the relevant material on this site in the format of recorded topical videos and reading material. Supplementary material may be provided as links to other relavant text books, videos, or articles. 

**Learning by doing:**
This is a practical course where you will work with the material through a set of assignments and an embedded systems project. 

<!--Supplementary material will be provided either as recorded topical videos or reading material on this webpage or from relevant text books and articles.
-->

After completing this course:
* you will have knowledge of the basic building blocks and functionality of programmable logic devices
* you will have knowledge of application areas for programmable logic devices
* you will be able to design a basic digital system using a hardware description language like VHDL
* you will be able to perform simulation and synthesis of digital systems for FPGAs
* you will have basic knowledge of embedded and Real-Time operating systems, and be able to implement them on an FPGA

<!--
The course will:
* give a brief introduction to the basic building blocks of digital logic relevant for FPGAs:
  * Logic gates, multiplexer, flip-flops;
  * including an overview of overview of programmable logic devices: PROM, PLA, PAL, GAL, CPLD, FPGA;
* give an introduction to FPGA technology:
  * Logic blocks, Look-up Tables, configuration bits, softcore and hardcore CPU;
* give an introduction to the hardware description languague VHDL:
  * Design units, description models, VHDL objects and assignments, process statements, combination logic, synchronous logic, sequential logic, state machines, tools, design flow, simulation and test benches;
* cover basic concepts of embedded and real-time systems through an example project:
  * constraints and characteristics, 
  * hardware abstraction,
  * task, scheduling, context switch, intertask communication (messages, queues, semaphores),
  * softcore implementation on FPGA (NIOS II) and memory mapped I/O
  * basic programming c.
