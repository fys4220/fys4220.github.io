%Last year (2020), this was supported by the reading material listed below. Some changes may be expected. However, relevant chapters and sections from these sources will be specified in relation to the topics covered and presented through the Canvas Modules for this course.


**Mealy and Teppero, “Free range VHDL”**

For a basic introduction to VHDL the "Free range VHDL"  by Mealy and Teppero can be a good starting point. The book has until recently been available to download for free under "Creative Commons Attribution-ShareAlike Unported License" from http://freerangefactory.org. This link seems no longer to be active. The Latex source can however be found on Github: https://github.com/fabriziotappero/Free-Range-VHDL-book, from where it can be downloaded and compiled to a pdf. A compiled version is avaiable [here](../docs/free_range_vhdl.pdf).
