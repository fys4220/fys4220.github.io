# Other resources


## Recommended reading
There are no single text book that fully covers the complete curriculum. The curriculum is therefore based on topics covered in the recorded lectures and the content and material presented on these pages, including the practical exercises and embedded systems project assignment.

There are nevertheless numerous text books and online resources available that can be used for further reading and depth. A few examples a listed below. These will be referred to on this page when relevant.


%Last year (2020), this was supported by the reading material listed below. Some changes may be expected. However, relevant chapters and sections from these sources will be specified in relation to the topics covered and presented through the Canvas Modules for this course.

* - **Mealy and Teppero, “Free range VHDL”**<br><br>
For a basic introduction to VHDL the "Free range VHDL"  by Mealy and Teppero can be a good starting point. The book has until recently been available to download for free under "Creative Commons Attribution-ShareAlike Unported License" from http://freerangefactory.org. This link seems no longer to be active. The Latex source can however be found on Github: https://github.com/fabriziotappero/Free-Range-VHDL-book, from where it can be downloaded and compiled to a pdf. A compiled version is avaiable {download}`here <./docs/free_range_vhdl.pdf>`.

* - **Brock J. LaMeres, "Introduction to Logic Circuits & Logic Design with VHDL"**<br><br>
This book from LaMeres provides basic introduction to logic circuits, programmable logic and FPGAs, and VHDL. This book can also be accessed online through the [university library](https://bibsys-almaprimo.hosted.exlibrisgroup.com/primo-explore/fulldisplay?docid=TN_cdi_askewsholts_vlebooks_9783030124892&context=PC&vid=UIO&lang=no_NO&search_scope=default_scope&adaptor=primo_central_multiple_fe&tab=default_tab&query=any,contains,introduction%20to%20logic%20circuits%20and%20logic%20design%20with%20vhdl&offset=0).
The most relevant chapters are: chapter 5 VHDL (Part 1), chapter 8 VHDL (Part 2), and chapter 9 Behavioral modeling of sequential logic.

* - **P. J. Ashenden, “The Designer’s guide to VHDL”**<br><br>
This book can be used as a more extensive resource to the VHDL language Ashenden's "The Designer's guide to VHDL".
<br><br>
The book is currently available online at [O’Reilly for Higher Education](https://bibsys-k.userservices.exlibrisgroup.com/view/action/uresolver.do?operation=resolveService&package_service_id=11556943850002204&institutionId=2204&customerId=2200) and can be accessed through the [university library](https://bibsys-almaprimo.hosted.exlibrisgroup.com/primo-explore/fulldisplay?docid=TN_cdi_askewsholts_vlebooks_9780080568850&context=PC&vid=UIO&lang=no_NO&search_scope=default_scope&adaptor=primo_central_multiple_fe&tab=default_tab&query=any,contains,Digital%20System%20Design%20with%20VHDL&mode=Basic)

* - **Michael Barr and Anthony Massa, Programming Embedded Systems, 2nd Edition.**<br><br>
All though written in 2006, and using a different hardware system than for FYS4220, this book covers many general aspects that still are valid.
<br><br>
The book is currently available online at [O’Reilly for Higher Education](https://learning.oreilly.com/library/view/programming-embedded-systems/0596009836/ch01.html) and can be accessed through the [university library](https://bibsys-almaprimo.hosted.exlibrisgroup.com/primo-explore/fulldisplay?docid=BIBSYS_ILS71529520750002201&context=L&vid=UIO&lang=no_NO&search_scope=default_scope&adaptor=Local%20Search%20Engine&isFrbr=true&tab=default_tab&query=any,contains,Programming%20Embedded%20Systems). The relevant chapters are: Chapter 1 - Introduction, and Chapter 10 - Operating systems.
