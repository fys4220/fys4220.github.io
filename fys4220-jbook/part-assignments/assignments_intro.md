# Overview

Before starting on the main part of the project it is required to work through an introductory assignment to familiarise yourself with the Quartus Prime design tools and to learn writing basic VHDL code for both a combinational and synchronous FPGA design. You will also write your first basic test bench.


To help you get started, the description is rather detailed for the first assignment. As you get familiar with the tools and writing VHDL, you are expected work on and complete the assignments -- and later the project -- more independently.


The introductory assignment consist of four parts:

- {ref}`assignments-first-project`
    - Getting started with tools and writing your first VHDL design
- {ref}`assignments-seven-segment-display`
    - Writing your first combinational logic in VHDL
- {ref}`assignments-synchronous-logic`
    - Writing your first logic using a VHDL process and simulating this logic.
- {ref}`assignments-synchronization`
    - Sampling asynchronous signals

Before you start, you should {ref}`information-preparing-git`.
