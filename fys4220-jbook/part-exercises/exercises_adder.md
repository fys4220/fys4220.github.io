# EX2: Adder

The goal of this exercise is to create a 4-bit full adder. The adder will add two 4-bit values defined by the slide swithces and show the result on the LEDs.

```{admonition} The learning outcome of this exercise is to:
* Be able to describe basic combinational logic with VHDL.
* Be able to simulate your design using a basic VHDL test bench and Modelsim
* Be able to partition your design in sub-units and combine then using a structural design.
```

Before you start to write code it is always smart to first spend some time to think about and plan how you want to solve the problem. It can e.g., be helpful to draw a basic block diagram or schematic to outline your design. 

The first step is to make sure you know how to design an adder using logic gates. If you do not already know how to do this, use a relevant text book or online resources to refresh your knowledge.


## 1-bit half adder

Pre

Test in hardware but do not simulate

## 1-bit full adder
From this point we start to simulate.


## 4-bit full adder
