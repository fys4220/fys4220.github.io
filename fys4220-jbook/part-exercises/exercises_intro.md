# Overview

Before you embark on the main project it is highly recommended to work through all of the exercises. These exercises will cover topics which are relevant for solving the problems in the project, and allow you to familiarize yourself with the Quartus Prime design tools as well as Modelsim.

To help you get started, the description is rather detailed for the first exercise. As you get familiar with the tools and writing VHDL, you are expected work on and complete the exercises -- and later the project -- more independently.

You can find suggestied solution examples to the exercises on Github: https://github.com/fys4220/fys4220-exercises


<!--
The introductory assignment consist of four parts:

- {ref}`assignments-first-project`
    - Getting started with tools and writing your first VHDL design
- {ref}`assignments-seven-segment-display`
    - Writing your first combinational logic in VHDL
- {ref}`assignments-synchronous-logic`
    - Writing your first logic using a VHDL process and simulating this logic.
- {ref}`assignments-synchronization`
    - Sampling asynchronous signals

Before you start, you should {ref}`information-prepare-git`.
