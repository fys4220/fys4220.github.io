 # VHDL

VHDL is a language for describing digital electronic systems {cite}`ashenden`. It is short for  _VHISC_ Hardware Description Language, 
_VHISC_: Very High Speed Integrated Circuits. 

It supports different needs in the design process:
- It can be used to describe the structure of a system, that is, how it is decomposed into subsystems and how those subsystems are interconnected. 
- Further, it can be used to desribe the function of a system using familiar programming syntax. 
- It can be used to simulate the system. This allows the designer to test the correctness of the system before it is implemented in hardware. 
- It allows the detailed structure of a design to be synthesized from a more abstract specification, allowing designers to concentrate on more strategic design decisions and reducing the time to market.
